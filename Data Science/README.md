## **Goodreads Book Dataset Cleaning**

This project is on a dataset which includes thousands of books from Goodreads.
Goodreads is a website where users can review and give books a rating. I set out
to clean the data and create an effective dashboard on Tablaeu.

**Skills**: \
• EDA \
• Regex \
• Lambda functions 

## **YouTube Trending**

YouTube's trending page is an imfamous part of YouTube that creators strive to reach.
When a video reaches "trending" status it means an algorithm has picked out
that video due to a wide range of factors, and deemed it worthy for the YouTube
trending page. In this project I explore the data of the YouTube trending page
for the UK from 2017-2018.

**Skills**: \
• EDA \
• Regex \
• Lambda functions \
• Data visualisation \
• Pivot Tables

## **Fish CNN**

For fishermen it may be an easy task when asked to differencitate between fish. For most it
is not so easy. Even if there were to be a task that was easy for most, it may be time consuming.
That's where machine learning comes in, more specifically, a convolutional neural network.
For this project I set out with developing a basic CNN to classify 9 different species of fish wiht
a dataset I found on Kaggle.

**Skills**: \
• Importing images and reducing their resolution \
• Developed a CNN that can classify 9 different species of fish with a 99% accuracy \
• Data visualisation

## **Predicting the IMDb rating of a movie, based on other popular websites**

Predicting the IMDb rating of a movie, based on other popular websites. The website in question are

move straight to data visualisation
