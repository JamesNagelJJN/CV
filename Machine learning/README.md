## **Fish CNN**
------------------------------------------------

**The Project**

For fishermen it may be an easy task when asked to differencitate between fish. For most it 
is not so easy. Even if there were to be a task that was easy for most, it may be time consuming.
That's where machine learning comes in, more specifically, a convolutional neural network.
For this project I set out with developing a basic CNN to classify 9 different species of fish wiht
a dataset I found on Kaggle.

**Skills**: \
• Importing images and reducing their resolution \
• Developed a CNN that can classify 9 different species of fish with a 99% accuracy \
• Data visualization
