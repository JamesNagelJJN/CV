## **Fast Fourier Transform**

In its most basic form the fast fourier transform can efficiently break down a wave into its
constituent elements. For this project we were given a wave and we have to deconstruct the wave
and display the waves that make it up, and then rebuild it.

## **Final year project - Nuclear physics**

When two footballs collide we can use basic kinematic physics to predict the outcome of the 
collision. When we deal with particles, in this case neutrons, we have to use Schrodinger equation
to understand what is happening to the particles. I was challenged with calculaing the eigen values
and energies of the two particles.

## **Monte Carlo simulation**

The Monte Carlo method is a method of random sampling to obtain results. For this project
we were tasked with calculating the volume of a sphere up to the 15th dimension.

## **Statistical analysis of Tesco PLC stock price**

We were tasked with analysing a company's stock. I chose Tesco. In this project
we had to forecast the stock price, calculate put and call options and explore the 
data using statistical methods.

## **XOR Gate Neural network**

We had to create a neural network that is trained using the metropalis 
algorithm. The metropalis algorithm takes the overall neural network as 
a system that has energy (Certain factors go in to calculating the energy). 
The weights are assigned randomly and then random changes are made to the weights.
Certain random movements of the weights will be accepted, as long as it lowers the energy
of the system. Along with this I created a user-friendly output.
